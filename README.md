# CS2800

This repository has been created to store your CS2800 work.

You may edit it as you like, but please do not remove the default topics or the project members list. These need to stay as currently defined in order for your lecturer to be able to find and mark your work.

For the markers of the Project:

    - I have realised that some of my commits have an account name as "Spiderfav". Now I don't exactly know how since my machines are using the access tokens created to commit the files. I've tried to change it now but if any commit appears as "Spiderfav" it really should appear as "Rui Favinha". "Spiderfav" is just my normal GitHub and online user handle.
